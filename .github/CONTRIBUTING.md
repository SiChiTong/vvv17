#### General rules for posting

- Issue tracking systems can be seen as **advantageous alternatives to mailing lists** (see this [**post**](https://github.com/robotology/QA/issues/118)).
- All **issues are public**, but to post a new issue you need a github account (free).
- To be able to assign **labels** to questions, ask teachers to become a **collaborator**.
- Post here your **question** and mark it with a **suitable label**. Then, mention the teacher who you deem can help you.
- We try to be neat and thus we _aim_ to **close questions** that have found their answers :smirk:.

If you would like us to review your code, please post your snippets to [**`Gist`**](https://gist.github.com), including instructions to run them.
